*StringsInObj*
--------------
A small program to print out all printable characters found in the input file. Prints the file offset along with the printed character/string. Useful for finding something about packed software (like if you are dealing with a malware).

Please feel free to reuse code from this project. Kindly include a reference to me in your code. :)

*USAGE*
-------
usage: .\StringsInObj.exe <pathToInputFile>

Warning: All output printed to stdout. It would be wise to redirect output to a file.
